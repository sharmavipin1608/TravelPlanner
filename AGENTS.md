# Agent Registry

Quick routing reference for the orchestrator. Full agent prompts in `agents/`.

## Pipeline Order

Researcher → Coder → Reviewer → Tester → Security → Git → DevOps → Memory

> Changelog runs separately at end of day or end of sprint — not part of the per-task pipeline.

## Pipeline Variants

| Variant | Agents | When |
|---|---|---|
| Full (default) | Researcher → Coder → Reviewer → Tester → Security → Git → DevOps → Memory | FORCE_FULL verdict, or orchestrator judges complex |
| Fast-Track | Coder → Tester → Security → Git → DevOps → Memory | AMBIGUOUS verdict + orchestrator judges simple |

Security, DevOps, and Memory are never skippable in either variant.

## When to Dispatch Each Agent

| Agent | File | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Researcher | `agents/researcher.md` | Unknown domain, new technology, need external context before coding |
| Coder | `agents/coder.md` | Any implementation task — always follows TDD |
| Reviewer | `agents/reviewer.md` | After Coder completes — checks conventions and correctness |
| Tester | `agents/tester.md` | After Reviewer PASS — adds integration and acceptance tests |
| Security | `agents/security.md` | After Tester — hard gate, pipeline stops on BLOCKERS |
| Git | `agents/git.md` | After Security PASS — commits and pushes |
| DevOps | `agents/devops.md` | After Git — polls CI until pass or fail; runs smoke test against deployed endpoint |
| Memory | `agents/memory.md` | After DevOps PASS — marks task `completed` in TASKS.md, updates facts, checkpoint, episodic log |
| Changelog | `agents/changelog.md` | End of day or end of sprint |
| Writer | `agents/writer.md` | (1) Plan approved → bulk-populate TASKS.md before coding; (2) Documentation explicitly needed |

## Dispatch Rules

1. Pass only the context the agent needs — no full history
2. Always include the relevant skill file path in the dispatch
3. Security agent is a hard gate — never skip it, never batch it with Git; on BLOCKERS mark task `blocked` in TASKS.md
4. DevOps agent is a hard gate — never skip it; on CI FAILED mark task `blocked` in TASKS.md
5. Memory agent runs after every completed pipeline task — it owns marking tasks `completed` in TASKS.md
6. Orchestrator marks a task `in_progress` in TASKS.md at dispatch time — Memory agent marks it `completed` at the end
7. Writer runs outside the main pipeline — always spawn it after plan approval to populate TASKS.md before handing off to Coder
8. Log the pipeline variant and reason for every task — format:
   `timestamp | ORCHESTRATOR | PIPELINE:full | REASON:auth file touched`
